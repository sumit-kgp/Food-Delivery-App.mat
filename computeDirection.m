%% Function to compute direction using desired direction matrix and
% neighborhood matrix, takes current and previous coordinates of delivery
% person, both the 3x3 matrix output of searchNeighborhood.m and
% desiredDirection.m and a flag 
% 
% - flag == 0 when one of the available positions is the desired position to take
% - flag == 2 when both the available position are desired positions to take, mostly occurs at corners so here we force a turn
% - flag == 1 when none of the available positions are desired positions to take, mostly occurs when source and edstination are on paralle lines
%   Here, we force the DP to go along the direction its going till it encounters a turn and then turn the flag to 2.
